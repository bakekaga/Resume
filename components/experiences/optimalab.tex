\begin{itemize}
	\item Conducted research in \textbf{machine learning optimization} investigating distributed methods of solving large-scale linear regression problems.
	\item Formulated novel algorithms based on random feature subsampling; experiments varying hyperparameters and step-size schemes achieved a mean-squared error \textbf{below 0.001}. Reviewed prior literature on federated learning and proximal gradient methods.
