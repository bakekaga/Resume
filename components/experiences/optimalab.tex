\textit{Undergraduate Researcher} \hfill May 2023--Present

\begin{itemize}
	\item Conducted research in \textbf{machine learning optimization}; specifically investigated novel methods of solving large-scale linear systems distributively. Implemented algorithms based on feature subsampling; experiments varying hyperparameters and step-size schemes achieved a mean-squared error \textbf{below 0.001}.
